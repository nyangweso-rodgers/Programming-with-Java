# Overview Of Java

- **Java** was/is a simpler, safer version of **C++**.

# History of Java

- **Java** was launched in 1991 when **James Gosling** and his team at Sun Microsystems began development on the language.

- **Java** was offered to the public in 1995 for usage in various applications ranging from the internet to computer programming.

# Features of Java

1. **Strong Static Typing** - when you declare a variable, you have to indicate its type.

   ```java
       int dataValue;
       dataValue = 10;

       int myVariable = 15;
   ```

2. **C-style syntax**. Apparently some people believe this is a good thing.
3. **Object oriented**
4. **Garbage collection**
5. **Fast in the right hands.**
6. **Portable**
7. **Easy to understand most of the time.**

# Why you should use Java for Backend Development

1. **Scalability and Robustness**:

   - Java has a robust type-checking mechanism that makes it durable. The **Java virtual machine** (JVM) enables dynamic linking and a secure environment, allowing Java to run anywhere.

   - Java's automatic memory management and disposal collection make it highly scalable and these features help speed up web application development.

2. **Open Source Library**:

   - There are many Java libraries for various uses, including logging, JSON parsing, unit testing, XML and HTML parsing, messaging, PDF and Excel reading, cryptography, and many others.

3. **Diversity**:

   - Java has long been the dominant programming language for developing Web applications, Android applications, and software tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans IDE, and others.

4. **Security**:

   - Java reduces security concerns and dangers by reducing the use of explicit pointers. A pointer is a value that keeps the memory address of another value and can be exploited to gain unwanted memory access. This issue is solved by removing the concept of pointers.

5. **Platform Independency**:

   - Java is platform-independent, which means it's a "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) language.

   - The compiled code (the byte code of Java) is platform-independent and can run on any machine, irrespective of the operating system. We can run this code on any machine that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

6. **Multithreading Support**:
   - Java is a multithreaded language, which means that multiple threads can run at the same time.
   - A thread is a process's smallest unit. Multithreading allows us to maximize CPU use. Multiple threads share the same memory space, increasing the application's efficiency and performance.

# Drawbacks of the Java Programming Language

1. **Lack of Backup Facility**:

   - Java is primarily concerned with storage and does not prioritize data backup. This is a huge drawback, and it is losing user interest and ratings as a result.

2. **Code Complexity**:

   - Java code is extensive, which means it contains many words and long, complex sentences that are hard to read and comprehend. This reduces the code's readability.

3. **Speed and Performance Level**:

   - Java consumes a large amount of memory and is substantially slower than native languages such as C or C++. This is partly because each bit of code must be interpreted into machine-level code. This slow performance is caused by the JVM's additional level of compilation and abstraction.

4. **Memory Capacity**:
   - When compared to other languages such as C and C++, Java uses a significant amount of memory. Memory efficiency and system performance may suffer during cleanup execution.

# Differences Between a Java Backend and a `Node.js` Backend

- In terms of strengths, **Java** has the advantage of being a **statically-typed language**, which provides better performance and stability. **Node.js**, on the other hand, has the advantage of being a **dynamically-typed language**, which makes it easier to learn and more flexible.

- **Java** also provides better security features, such as the **Java Virtual Machine** (JVM), which has memory protection and isolation. Java also has a large number of libraries and tools available, which makes it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications.

- `Node.js` is also well-suited for real-time applications, such as chat applications, thanks to its event-driven architecture. `Node.js` also has a large and active community, which provides a wealth of libraries and tools for various tasks.

# Setting Java Development Environment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Java Development Kit (JDK)

- `JDK` is a set of software tools and libraries that allows developers to create **Java** applications.
- It is a fundamental requirement for developing Java applications because it provides the necessary components, including the:

  - **Java Compiler**:

    - The **JDK** includes a **Java compiler**, which translates human-readable Java code into machine-readable bytecode that can be executed on any device with a **JVM**.

  - **Java Runtime Environment** (**JRE**):

    - The `JRE` is a part of the **JDK** that allows Java applications to run on various platforms.
    - It includes the **JVM** and core Java class libraries that are required for running Java programs.

  - **Java Virtual Machine** (**JVM**):

    - The **JVM** is a key component of the **JDK** that enables Java code to be executed on different platforms without the need for recompilation.
    - It interprets the bytecode generated by the Java compiler and translates it into machine code for the specific platform on which it is running.

  - **Java APIs**:
    - The **JDK** includes a vast library of **APIs** that provide developers with access to various functionalities, such as database connectivity, network programming, GUI development, and more.

## Java Development Environment in VS Code

- Step 1:

  - Download and install [Java Development Kit]() (JDK).
  - You can download the **JDK** from the official [Oracle website]().

- Step 2:

  - After you finish **JDK** installation, please reload Visual Studio Code to make it effective.

- Step 3:

  - Install the [Java Extension Pack]() in VSCode.
  - This pack includes everything you need to develop Java applications in Visual Studio Code.

- Step 4:

  - Create a new Java project.
  - Open VS Code and create a new folder where you want to save your Java project. Then, open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` shortcut key and type "`Java: Create Java Project`". Press Enter and select a location for the project. Choose a name for your project and select a **JDK** version to use.

- Step 5:

  - Create a Java file with "Hello World" code.
  - Once the project is created, open the `src` folder and create a new Java file with the name `HelloWorld.java`.
  - Copy and paste the following code into the file:

    ```java
        public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
    ```

- Step 6:
  - Run the program.
  - Open the Command Palette and type "`Java: Run Java Program`" and press Enter.
  - This will run your program and the output "Hello, World!" should be displayed in the console.
